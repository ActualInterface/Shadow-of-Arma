ï»¿Important NVG Explanation!
due to how reshade operates and the subtle differences between normal eyes, FLIR and NVG we need to use the keybinds we setup earlier to change modes

Dual Mode Nods
 When turning NVG's on we use N to cycle the NVG modes and presets, simply press N the ammount of times you need to cycle, This CANT break

Single Mode Nods
